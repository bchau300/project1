# Bryan Chau's Project

All the project I have created in the past

## Capstone Project

Currently working on my capstone project for my capstone class. I am done with the project but still waiting for the class to end to mark it as complete.
Description: An internal site that allows to keep records of appointments and send alert messages to patients

## Name change Discord Bot

This bot was made with python and would change certain user name into a predefine name list.

## Theater of Blood Damage caluclator

This script was made in the runelite plugin. This plugin would calculate the damage between you and the boss. The damage you have taken and the damage you have dealt.
After the fight is complete would caluclate the damage you have done and see if you're carrying your own weight.

## Twitter Filter and listening

This script was made for my school project. To see the a corrletion with bitcoin price and the amount of tweet. In the end of the project there wasn't a big correlation. 
The project was done in March-Apirl 2018.
